# ADS505-Final-Group-Project

The purpose of this project is to help a the Bank of Portugal optimize its telemarketing campaign efforts by predicting which customers are most likely to subscribe to term deposits. This will allow the bank to focus resources more effectively on potential customers, saving time and money. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. Using Python, we conducted EDA, data preprocessing, and developed and trained predictive models to help the bank identify potential customers, leading to improved conversion rates for term deposits, reduced campaign costs, and better overall marketing efficiency. 
We trained and validated three predictive models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors. Initially, we trained the models without addressing class imbalance. However, after recognizing the impact of class imbalance in the validation results, SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied to balance the dataset. The logistic regression stood out as the optimal model because it had the highest recall score, which is crucial for identifying potential customers, and offered a more balanced performance, despite having a slightly lower accuracy compared to the other models. 
The Bank of Portugal can utilize this model in future campaigns to improved conversion rates for term deposits, reduced campaign costs, and have a better overall marketing efficiency.
